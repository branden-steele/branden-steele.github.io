Hello, world!
I'm Branden.
I'm an AI Engineer building production-grade features with agents, GenAI, and as many other AI / ML tools and frameworks as I can keep up with.

### Why I'm writing

#### Reason \#1: To share my learnings with anyone else wanting to learn

I'm extremely fortunate to work in a field that is at the forefront of human innovation, using cutting-edge technology every day, and contributing to the state of the art.
And while it's never been easier to learn, especially about a tech-friendly field like AI, I am hoping my particular career trajectory might offer unique insights, or at least a unique perspective.
Ultimately, this is the weakest reason, but we all want to have an impact on others, right?


#### Reason \# 2: To keep track of things

This field moves FAST.
Paradigm shifts can happen in the span of weeks, even days.
It's truly wild.

Because of this, I sometimes find myself dizzy trying to keep track of all of the newest models, methods, etc.

Maybe the idea of spending time writing instead of reviewing the latest breakthroughts is ironic.
But I'm a firm believer that writing is really just disciplined thinking.
And I think I'd rather spend some time each week doing some disciplined thinking about whatever is top of mind rather than relying on absorbing knowledge solely from cramming posts from the AI-verse.



#### Reason \# 3: I love to write

This is the biggest, most honest reason I'm doing this - I genuinely love writing.
Many folks think I went to grad school because I love STEM, but secretly, it's because I love writing, especially about STEM.
And if I'm being perfectly honest, I do worry that as AI continues to improve and integrate into our lives, I along with everyone else will write less and less.
I'm hoping that committing to a blog will keep my writing skills sharp, and keep me writing.
