### üëã Hello, world! I'm Branden Olson Steele (BOS) -- AI engineer, new parent, and coffee addict.
After working for over a decade at the frontier between research, data science, and production AI, I‚Äôm finally starting the blog I‚Äôve been meaning to write for, well... over a decade.

I love building production-grade AI / ML features and systems, with a recency bias towards agents, GenAI, and LLMs, but without losing my soft spot for classical statistical modeling.
I've been involved in a number of challenging projects, surrounded by many talented engineers, scientists, and mentors, yet am humbled every day by how deep this rabbit hole goes.

Over the years, I've wanted to do a lot more writing on AI Engineering topics, but never quite found the time.
However, in the last year, I shipped my biggest career project to date (more on that later), I welcomed my first child to the world (Ada, named after you-know-the-one), and left a fortune 500 company for a start-up.
It goes without saying that my time has never been a more precious resource.
Naturally, I've decided that it's finally time to start a blog for real.


### ü•Ö Goals of the blog

This blog is:
* a forum for my thoughts, experiences, and lessons learned in the world of AI Engineering
* a builder's journal: scrappy, occasionally messy, always honest, raw, and most importantly, curious
* a reflection of my own experiences and viewpoints (I can be and often am wrong, so don't quote me üòâ)

This blog is NOT:
* a research blog with journal-tier contributions (though I try my best to apply a research-oriented mindset to AI Engineering)
* a plug or product pitch, though I will unabashedly rave about any tools that make me a happy engineer
* a guarantee of novel ideas - I'll write about what's on my mind, and my apologies if the ideas have been stated before, but hopefully there will be a nugget or two for the gleaning

### üñäÔ∏è Why I'm writing

#### Reason \#1: To share my learnings with anyone else wanting to learn

I'm extremely fortunate to work in a field at the forefront of human innovation, using cutting-edge technology every day, and sometimes contributing to the state of the art.
And while it's never been easier to learn, especially about a tech-friendly field like AI, I am hoping my particular career trajectory might offer unique perspectives, and maybe even meaningful insights.



#### Reason \# 2: To keep track of things

This field moves FAST.
Paradigm shifts happen in the span of weeks, even days.
It's truly wild.

Because of this, I sometimes get dizzy trying to keep track of all of the newest models, methods, etc.
Friends or colleagues will ask about the LatestAIChatbot version New.3 and I'm frequently embarassed to be out of the loop.
Where does anyone find the time?

On the other hand, I've always felt that writing is one of the best ways to learn, so why not write about this field as a means of having more informed ideas and opionions on these shiny new gadgets?

Maybe the idea of spending even more time writing on top of reviewing the latest breakthroughs is a bit ironic.
But I'm a firm believer that writing is simply structured, disciplined, critical thinking.
And I think I'd rather spend some time each week doing some disciplined thinking about whatever is top of mind rather than relying on absorbing knowledge solely from nightly cram sessions of all my AI-verse feeds.



#### Reason \# 3: I love to write

This is the biggest, most honest reason I'm doing this - I genuinely love writing.
I always have.

Many folks think I went to grad school because I love STEM, but secretly, it's because I love writing, especially about STEM.

And if I'm being _perfectly_ honest, I do worry that as AI continues to improve and integrate into our lives, I along with most everyone else will write less and less.
I'm hoping that committing to a blog will keep my writing skills sharp, and keep me writing.


### üöÄ Let's go!

With this in mind, I'm excited to get started!
I hope you find this blog engaging.
I'll give some thought as to how I'd like folks to interact with my posts.
In the meantime, feel free to message me if you'd like to chat!

Happy AI engineering!


### Appendix: About the name

My birth surname was Olson, and I changed it to Olson Steele when I got married (my wife's maiden name was Steele, and her new surname is now also Olson Steele).
Thus, I am now B.O.S., which is some forced serendipity - "B.O. Life" just doesn't have the same ring to it... üòú
